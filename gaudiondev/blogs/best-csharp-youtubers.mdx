Here are the 5 best C# YouTubers to learn .Net (or DotNet) software development. These YouTubers taught me both the very basics of C# through to complex Software Architecture.


## 1. [IAmTimCorrey](https://www.youtube.com/iamtimcorey)

> Comprehensive & Thourough Tutorials

This Microsoft MVP had me hooked from day 1 of my C# Career. His videos span everything from learning the basics of the language & framework into more complex & hard concepts.

More recently, also producing videos on Careers in software developement as well as Cloud Native C# applications.

## 2. [Milan Jovanović](https://www.youtube.com/@MilanJovanovicTech)

> Practical DDD & Architecture Lessons

Milan is a Domain Driven Design (DDD) professional. His videos have been great in learning how to implement DDD concepts into the DotNet Languages. His videos are very practical (with code examples), diving into the architectural details of DDD, CQRS, Mediatr pattern.

On top of his channel, Milan also has a great email newsletter too.


## 3. [Nick Chapsas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrkPsvLGln62OMZRO6K-llg)

> Latest updates in C# Ecosystem

Averaging 3 videos a week, Nick Chapsas is storming out content related to the most relevant & recent changes to the DotNet ecosystem. Due to the fast-paced nature of the videos - they're not thorough tutorials like Tim Correy - however, they do help keep you up to date with the latest updates in the industry.  

With his growing audience, Nick was recently able to [interview Microsoft's own Dan Roth](https://youtu.be/2uLGXe95kTo?si=mDhj4qYwad7C6d_a), about the future of Blazor.  

## 4. [Scott Hanselman](https://www.youtube.com/@shanselman)

> Brings the Joy back to Tech

Scott is an icon in the tech industry. Despite working at Microsoft for {Math.round((new Date() - new Date(2007, 8)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365))} years he's still seems to have a child-like joy for all things technology. 

Alongside his VP status at Microsoft, he also has a successfuly blog, podcast & YouTube channel of his own - a great place to rekindle a joy of development.

## 5. [DotNet](https://www.youtube.com/@dotnet)

> Official DotNet Channel

We couldn't forget the official DotNet channel. A great place to learn about .Net Releases as well as learn about specific C# features. My faviorite series of this channel is the [Deep .Net](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oX8eqDkSw4hH9cSehrGgdr1&si=Iub3SDYbVjL0oIfS) playlist with Scott Hanselman & Stephen Toub as they dig into the low-level workings of C#.
