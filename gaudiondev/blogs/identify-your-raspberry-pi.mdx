There are over 12 variations of the Raspberry Pi - each with their own configuration of ports, RAM sizes and features. On top of this, every owner can then install a different operating system of choice onto their Pi. 

This blog will show you how to identify any Raspberry Pi, check the Pi's specs and see what operating system your Pi is running.


How to tell which model of Raspberry Pi you have?
------------------------------------------------

To check which model of Raspberry Pi you have, you can run this 1 simple command:

```
cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

You can now take a look at the revision number and check it against the following table, [**updated here**](https://elinux.org/RPi_HardwareHistory).


| Revision  | Model                           | RAM Size        |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- |

How to check how much RAM (memory) your Raspberry Pi has?
--------------------------------------------------------

To check how much RAM your Raspberry Pi has, you can try 1 of the 2 options.


### 1. CPU Info

If you follow the above step to find out which Raspberry Pi you have, you can follow this link to [elinux.org](https://elinux.org/RPi_HardwareHistory) to find out how much RAM that specific Raspberry Pi Model has.

### 2. Free Command
To see how much RAM you have have, how much RAM you have used and how much is available on your Raspberry Pi, you can use this simple command:

```bash
free -h
```

```
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          7.7Gi       205Mi       6.2Gi       163Mi       1.3Gi       7.1Gi
Swap:          99Mi          0B        99Mi
```


This command will show you the `total` amount of RAM, the amount of RAM that is `used` and the amount that is `free`.  


Identify which OS/Distro your Pi is running?
--------------------------------------------
To know which Raspberry Pi you have, you can use one of these 2 methods.


### 1. Standard Base Release Command 
To see which Operating System our Raspberry Pi is running, we can run the following Linux Standard Base Command. 

```
lsb_release -a
```

![Linux Standard Base Release Command](/img/blog/raspberry-pi/which-pi/linux-standard-base-release-command.webp)

Ad we can see, this Raspberry Pi is running Raspbian 9.13.

### 2. Cat Release Information

As an alternative approach to see which Linux Distribution our Raspberry Pi is running, we can run this cat command:

```
cat /etc/*-release
```

![Which Raspberry Pi OS are you running?](/img/blog/raspberry-pi/which-pi/linux-cat-release.webp)

This shows us that we're running Raspbian Stretch 9.
