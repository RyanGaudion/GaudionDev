![YouTube Video Embedded in MDX Page using Next.Js](/img/blog/mdx/mdx-youtube-embed.png)

In this tutorial I'll show you how to setup a YouTube Video Embed Component (in Next.Js) for your MDX pages that will allow you to share your videos across your Markdown Pages.

## Requirements 

For this tutorial, I expect you've already got MDX setup inside your Next.Js application. If you haven't done this yet then follow this tutorial:

> [MDX Next.Js Blog Tutorial](/blog/nextjs-mdx-blog)

## 1) YouTube Video Embed - MDX Component

The first thing we need to do is to create our new component. Inside my application this will go in the `components/mdx` folder in a file called `YouTube.tsx`.

```tsx
//components/mdx/YouTube.tsx
export default function YouTube ({ id } : { id : string }){
  return (
    <div>
      <iframe
        className="aspect-video w-full"
        src={"https://www.youtube.com/embed/" + id}
        title="YouTube Video Player"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
      ></iframe>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Let's take a look at the different parts of this:
- `iframe` - this allows us to embed other web pages inside of our application.
- `aspect-video` & `w-full` - these are TailwindCSS classes that will set the width of the video to 100% and ensure the aspect ratio stays at 16:9.
- `src` - here we set our iframe to the YouTube embed URL with our video ID as a parameter. See below how to find your YouTube video ID.
- `allow` - This gives us control over which permissions we allow for the YouTube iframe. 

## 2) Import your MDX Component

Before we can use this component on our page, we first need to add it to our MDX components. For this tutorial, I'm using `next-mdx-remote`, however this is very similar for all MDX packages:

First import our YouTube component:

```tsx
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
import YouTube from '@/components/mdx/YouTube'
```

Then add the component to our mdx components: 

```tsx
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
<MDXRemote source={props.content} components={{Button, YouTube}}/>
```

## 3) Embed YouTube Videos in your MDX Pages

Now that the component is setup, we can add YouTube videos to our mdx blogs like this:

```jsx
// blogs/first-blog.mdx

<YouTube id="gCbGmAFqLoU"/>
```

Make sure you change the ID to that of the specific YouTube video you want to embed. With that complete, your page will have a YouTube video embedded directly within it like this video below:

<YouTube id="DJMTWuz2ksk"/>
{/*TODO:MDX - Change to YouTube Embed Video*/}

It's as simple as that; you now have YouTube videos embedded in your MDX pages with your Next.Js application.
