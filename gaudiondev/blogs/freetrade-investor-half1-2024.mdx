Freetrade's new CEO (Viktor Nebehaj) kicked off the H1'24 shareholder meeting with Freetrade's new 3 goals:

> "Transform Freetrade into the leading self-directed investment platform in the UK."

> "Focus, collaboration and accelerate our execution."

> "Create shareholder value by growing an efficient, cash-generative technology business."

These goals follow Freetrade's decision to stop operations in Sweden (and lose their EU license), with regained focus back towards profitability in the UK market.

That new regained focus has Freetrade setting its eyes on larger portfolios with a goal of customers with ¬£10k+ portfolios.

## Results
Freetrade continues its streak of profitability with ¬£13.1 million in revenue (34% increase over H1'23) and a profitable EBITDA of ¬£91,000.

Other notable improvements are net inflows of ¬£233m (87% increase over H1'23), bringing AUA (Assets under Administration) to ¬£2.0 billion. 

Growth has come in many KPI areas too:
- Trading Volume - Doubled over H1'23
- Increase in Average Trade Size
- Average Customer AUA up 39%
- ISAs & SIPPs AUA up 43% to ¬£1.3 billion
- Gross Profit margin of 94%

| Summary P&L (¬£'000) | H1'24 | H1'23 | % Change | 
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue | 13,107 | 9,770 | 34% |
| Direct Costs | (757) | (753) | (1%) |
| Gross Profit | 12,350 | 9,017 | 37% |
| Gross Profit Margin | 94% | 92% | 2 ppts |
| Marketing | (1,517) | (962) | (58%) |
| Overheads | (10,742) | (13,700) | 22% |
| Adjusted EBITDA | 91 | (5,645) | | n.m. |

Freetrade confirms they are in good financial health with a surplus of cash well above the regulatory requirements.

### Cost Reductions
Freetrade has reported ¬£2 million in cost reductions too, including the close of their Sweden branch as well as:

- Reducing headcount costs
- Offshoring work to Budapest - currently 30 employees are located there with an aim for 40 by the end of the year.
- Cheaper new office 
- Infrastructure cost reductions, plus lower supplier costs

### Comparisons to Targets set in 2023
In [Freetrade's 2023 fundraising campaign](/blog/freetrade-meetup-june-2023), they set "base" case and "growth" case targets for the end of 2024 based upon how much they fundraised, these goals were:

| | Base Case | Growth Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2023 Funding | ¬£7.5 million | ¬£11.9 million |
| 2024 Revenue | ¬£35.2 million | ¬£51.9 million |
| 2024 EBITDA | ¬£0.8 million | -¬£16.9 million |
| 2024 AUA | ¬£2.3 billion | ¬£3.2 billion |

On reflection of their first-half results, Freetrade noted FX revenue was bang on target, subscriptions were marginally behind target and interest revenue was ahead of estimates.

The major delta between the actual results and estimates was Share Lending (which was only recently released). Freetrade expected this to be released earlier in the year and as such revenue for this income stream has not yet hit expectations.

Due to the underfunding of their last investment round, they have also spent substantially less on marketing - ¬£1.5 million so far (instead of the original ¬£5 million plan).

Despite all this, Freetrade believes they are very much still on target for the base case for the end of 2024.

## North Star
It appears Freetrade's north star is their AUA (Assets under Administration) and they believe the way to increase this is to build the best product.

When asked why investors are leaving their platform they mentioned 2 common responses:

1. Those with smaller portfolios are moving towards extremely low-cost providers
2. People are looking for other products with simpler funds 

To keep AUA growing, and to keep this second group of customers, Freetrade is looking to release mutual funds in the future (no date was given).

## Growth
During the shareholder call, Freetrade was asked if they are still a "high growth" company and if so, where they see areas for "exponential growth".

Freetrade mentioned concentrating on high-value customers is its biggest area of growth. This involves focusing on getting larger portfolios transferred into the platform as well as changing/improving communication styles to talk correctly with these customers.

Freetrade's [recent rebranding](https://community.freetrade.io/t/freetrade-s-getting-a-fresh-new-look/73123) might be part of their plan to become a more sophisticated investment platform.

Viktor repeated his focus on "Product Lead Growth", aiming to build the best product to capitalise on the ¬£600 billion stocks & shares ISA industry.

## Product Roadmap
Freetrade's roadmap has always been an elusive topic. With hints of "Crypto", "EU Expansion" and "AI Features" all being canned before being released. Many long requested features such as Web are only just being released this year too.

Viktor seems to understand these concerns and is set on not promising features until they are confident they will release them.

Despite this conservative approach, we still have a few hints at what is planned.

### Planned

#### LISA & JISA 
Viktor confidently announced that new account types such as JISAs (Junior ISA) & LISAs (Lifetime ISA) will be getting started in the first half of 2025.

### Expected

#### Mutual Funds
Mutual funds are expected to help keep/attract the customers wanting "simplier" products. The team is expected to work on these soon - however no date was given.

#### Monitising Treasury Bills

It was originally decided that treasury bills would be charged from April 2024 however this hasn't yet happened.

Instead the plan appears to be to lock them behind subscriptions in order to make the Freetrade subscriptions more obviously valuable.

#### Guilts

The team also want to add Guilts and plans to monetise Treasury bills alongside the release of Guilts.

### Future

#### EU Expansion
EU Expansion was a hot topic for Freetrade many years ago however with the close of their Sweden office and the imminent removal of their license it no longer seems likely.

Before Freetrade will consider EU expansion again, Viktor mentioned it will first have to be cash flow positive and be in a position of strength (potentially at this point it would fundraise again to help fund a new EU expansion). However the UK is the focus for now.

#### Crypto
Despite hints in the past, crypto is no longer a priority to Freetrade. They'd be looking for clear UK regulatory guidance before commiting to this new product offering. They believe the current equity market they are focusing on is larger enough and they have to say no to certain things in order to build the product they would like.

## Internal 

Lots of development time has been spent improving Freetrade's internal platform to automate previously manual processes. This new improved platform - called "Freeflow" has enabled the automation of more dividend payments as well greatly automated the account transfer process.  

## IPO, Share Price & Future Funding

The hot topics of every shareholder meeting is the possibility of an exit. 

Freetrade have stated that in order to IPO they would first have to get the business to a point where investors want to invest. This involves must higher revenues and a meaninful EBITDA. 

The focus at the moment is building a valuable business through their product roadmap.

### Share Price

As a private company, Freetrade would not comment on their current share price as any valuation would "be finger in the wind guess".

### Future Funding 

With the turn to profitability, no immediate fundraising rounds are planned. Freetrade are not comparing themselves to other companies in the area but are instead focusing on "product & business success".

## Future Updates

Viktor promised future shareholder updates will continue every half a year with moe professional updates "in line with the maturity of our company".

Seems like the days of Community meetups at Freetrade's office with free Pizza & Swag are gone.
